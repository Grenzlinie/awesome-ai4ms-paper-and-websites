# Preface

本仓库记录关于LLM (large language models)和AI/ML在材料科学中应用的文献，特别是关于LLM在材料中的应用。看过的文章会至少用一句话概括内容，有些还会有notes。只有标题的就是还没看过的，只是先存档到这里。

# LLM + Materials

## RAG
None

## Agent
1. **一文详尽之LLM-Based Agent**(Wechat Website)[[Link]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/tprYtnARTwtSQwx3AZX4Zg) LLM-Based Agent的组件->规划、记忆、工具，单Agent和多Agent系统的架构，角色扮演的概念。
2. **A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous** (arXiv Dec 2024)[**Review**] [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11432) 探讨了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自主代理的构建、应用和评估方法。

## Knowledge distillation
1. 从零开始实现大模型知识蒸馏 -- Starting from scratch to achieve knowledge distillation of large models (Bilibili video Jan 2025) [[Link]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kQcoetEFM/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_custom_collection.content.click&vd_source=4c43a44b540724d9ab77627ff3efb406) 使用qwen2.5系列模型在特定任务上进行知识蒸馏，教师模型为qwen2.5-3b（qwen2.5-7b），学生模型为qwen2.5-0.5b，尝试只使用KL散度、微调学生模型加KL散度和不微调学生模型加交叉熵加KL散度等不同思路，并且使用了KL散度不同变种（反向KL散度，偏向前向KL散度，偏向反向KL散度）。反向 K2 散度优于前向 K2 散度,但仅仅微调学生模型准确度反而最好为80.3%。

# Materials with AI
## Properties Prediction
None

## Knowledge Extraction
1. Bridging AI and Science: Implications from a Large-Scale Literature Analysis of AI4Science (Arxiv Nov 2024) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09628) 大规模(159,295 papers)AI4S文献摘要分析。磁性材料，锂离子电池，钙钛矿太阳能电池是AI融合比较缺乏的领域。作者用文献训练了节点之间的link预测模型，传统的Node2Vec方法比较适合分析AI和Sci领域是否可能产生连接。
